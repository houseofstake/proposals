### 7. Moderation Standards  
7.1 Impartiality: moderators must have no conflicts of interest.  
7.2 Cultural and linguistic competence: include moderators who understand the parties’ context.  
7.3 Documentation: maintain secure records, a clear evidence trail, and access controls.  
7.4 Timeliness: target resolution within 14 calendar days; document and communicate extensions.  
7.5 AI oversight: AI-powered tools may assist with triage or pattern detection; humans make final decisions.  
7.6 Evidence standards: use verifiable records (e.g., logs, messages, transactions) and note limitations.  
7.7 Objectivity and Fairness: Once documents are ratified, they become legitimate and auditable standards.  
7.8 Hermeneutics: written content could be understood or interpreted differently, and clarification or appeals are a possibility for checks and balances.  

**7.9 Good Practice Example:**  
Assign moderators from outside the immediate dispute to ensure impartiality.

8.4.2 Consequence: time-bound restriction or suspension from channels or roles. Which can apply even while cases are being analyzed.  
8.4.3 Repair: reflection, mediation and a plan for corrective steps with conditions for return defined.  

**8.5 Permanent Ban**  
8.5.1 Observation: severe violation undermining safety, governance integrity or legitimacy.  
8.5.2 Consequence: removal from all governance spaces (on-chain and off-chain) to the greatest extent possible, including mitigating, reducing, or reversing financial damage when possible.  
8.5.3 Repair: not applicable; reserved for irreparable breaches of trust.  

**8.6 Proportionality Factors**  
Moderators will exercise judgement on the level of remedies based on intent, impact, prior history, cooperation, and community safety.  

### 9. Appeals Process  
9.1 Appeals body: Has at least 3 independent members, rotating annually with no conflicts of interest. The Appeals body composition and its selection process will be defined outside of scope of this proposal.  
9.2 Criteria: temporary restrictions and permanent bans can be appealed based upon new evidence (logs, screenshots, transaction records), a claim of misinterpreted evidence, procedural error or disproportionate sanctions.  
9.3 Timeframe: submit within 14 days; decision within 30 days.  
9.4 Submission: encrypted form or direct email to the Panel’s published contact.  
9.5 Finality: Panel decisions are binding, subject to community ratification in exceptional cases. Escalation to Screening Committee could be requested.  

**9.6 Good Practice Example:**  
A sanctioned member submits new logs that change the assessment; sanction reduced.  
Evidence shared is objective and within scope. (logs, screenshots, transaction records)  

**9.7 Bad Practice Example:**  
Multiple frivolous appeals filed to delay enforcement.  
Evidence shared is out of scope or subjective. (Behavior signaled is outside of HoS, biased claims, faulty evidence)  

### 10. Risk Disclosures & Limitations
10.1 Enforcement capacity depends on moderator resources and jurisdictional constraints.  
10.2 On-chain actions may be irreversible; remedies cannot fully counteract immutability.  
10.3 This CoC complements applicable law; it does not replace legal rights or obligations.  
10.4 Jurisdictional differences may require tailored measures while upholding core principles.  
10.5 Applicable jurisdiction for legal purposes is Cayman Island.  

### 11. Transparency & Governance Oversight  
11.1 All reports, evidence, decisions, feedback and enforcement actions are logged in an auditable but privacy-preserving way.  
11.2 Annual reports summarize cases, categories, timelines, outcomes, and reforms (respecting privacy where required).  
11.3 Committees overseeing this CoC maintain a public change log and explain major policy updates.  
11.4 Moderation team discloses their affiliations, incentives and responsibilities to reduce conflicts of interest.  
11.5 Oversight to all governance actors should be done by responsible bodies ensuring accountability and checks and balances. This is done working in sync with all HoS institutions and ruling documents.  
11.6 NEAR Foundation is accountable for moderation of its ecosystem’s platforms, including the House of Stake’s.  

### 12. Contact & Amendments
12.1 Contact: info@houseofstake.org.  
12.2 Amendments: updates follow a public notice and versioning process with a “Last Updated” date.  
12.3 Effective Date: this CoC takes effect upon community ratification and remains in force until amended.  
12.4 A minimum public comment period of 7 days is required prior to version adoption of this document, based on Art. 6.1.1 of the interim constitution.  

### END OF CODE OF CONDUCT POLICY V0.2.0  

    
</details>

## Context & Alignment

* [[**HSP‑001**](https://github.com/houseofstake/proposals/blob/main/HSPs/hsp-001.md)] defines Sensing as the way to gauge community sentiment prior to binding action; this proposal aims to confirm readiness to ratify the interim CoC.
* The CoC v0.2 specifies reporting channels (confidential form, email), moderation standards (impartiality, documentation, competence, human‑overseen AI), appeals timelines, auditable logging, and a minimum 7‑day public comment period for future versions, as well as proposed next steps for operationalization.  


## Situation

**- What problem are we solving?**

**Enabling Immediate Governance:** This version brings up an initial set of guidelines and approaches that once ratified, establish legitimate rules and boundaries for human behavior in NEAR's House of Stake. Providing a “good‑enough” baseline that can be adopted and tested for future updates and complimentary proposals.  

**- What happens if we don't address it?**

The House of Stake Community and its Moderators won’t have the tools to actually take care of the health of the social layer. HoS needs predictable norms to reduce friction and increase legitimacy. Waiting for a “perfect” policy risks more disorder than adopting a good baseline and improving it with evidence gathered from real use.  

If we do nothing. Ad‑hoc moderation persists; incident handling is inconsistent; coordination costs and reputational/legal risks rise; and legitimacy and participation suffer.  

## Mission  

Ensure a healthy culture of productive participation in achieving House of Stake's Mission, Vission & Values.  

**Objectives:** Enabling specific rule testing: This vote is a prior step ahead of a formal ratification vote, that would legitimate a first version (V1.0.0) of NEAR’s House of Stake Code of Conduct.  

**Outcomes:** Clearly defining rules and boundaries: Establishing legitimate shared agreements for interacting and managing conduct of agents inside NEAR’s House of Stake.  

## Approach  

A Code of Conduct should be voted on and approved by the community before May 31st, 2026. Which is the ratification deadline for the interim policy set.  

**What strategy will we use?**  
If this sensing proposal approved, the next step would be a ratification vote.  

**What are the risks and limitations?**  
The risks of not having a Code of Conduct ratified in the community is delaying the development of this, and further foundational policies needed for House of Stake planned functioning and modular evolution.  

## Technical Specification  

Once ratified, this Code of Conduct will be stored in [House of Stake documentation](https://houseofstake.org/docs/structure/code-of-conduct), taking effect and remaining in force until amended.  

## Backwards Compatibility  

Although no protocol or contract changes and no on‑chain parameters are affected. **It is important to note the compatibility with foundational governance assets -such as the Constitution & policy Charters**.  

This CoC directly supports Operationalizacion of following [constitutional articles](https://gov.near.org/t/near-house-of-stake-interim-constitution/41686).  

* Article 4. Institutions.  
* Article 5. Integrity, Conflicts of Interest, and Accountability.  
* Article 6. Legislative Procedure.  
* Article 11. Interpretation & Dispute Resolution.  


As a final remark on backwards compatibility, this CoC builds on NEAR Foundation’s Community Guidelines and NEAR Community Etiquette by encoding accountable, auditable governance behavior through clearly defined good/bad practice examples, transparent reporting duties, and a basis for an appeals framework.  


## Milestones

| Milestone | Target Date | Deliverable |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| Successful Sensing Proposal followed by a Decision Proposal | Q4 2025 | Decision vote succeeds with a simple majority of votes cast |
| Operationalization of Code of Conduct and Next steps | Q1 2026 | At least 1 implementation proposal|

## Key Performance Indicators

| KPI | Source of truth | Target |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
|Awareness and training. | Educational activities on the Code of Conduct and organizational policy set. | At least 3 Workshops and 1 blog post communicating organizational structure. |

Development on a proof of concept app: [Pulse](https://github.com/orgs/houseofstake/projects/1/views/1?pane=issue&itemId=128455369&issue=houseofstake%7Cpm%7C48) has already begun. |
|Performance efficiency. | Registry of cases reported, solved, and actions taken. | 66% of success in de-escalating and solving issues in stated times. |

## Budget & Resources

| Item | Amount | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| **Total** | 0 Ⓝ | This proposal does not request budget or resources for its implementation. |

**Reporting:** A progress report will be published before 31st May 2026, along with proposed amends or updates to match with additional ratified policy set.  

No funding is requested in this Sensing HSP. If the interim ratification proceeds, follow‑up proposals may request resources to operate reporting, moderation, appeals, transparency, and education.  

## Implementation  

**Contact and intake**  

* Confidential CoC reporting form on the official House of Stake website with anonymous option, clear privacy notice, and attachment support.  
* Email: activate [info@houseofstake.org](mailto:info@houseofstake.org).  
* Replace the draft CoC in [House of Stake documentation](https://houseofstake.org/docs/structure/code-of-conduct) with the ratified version.  
* Add links to the Code of Conduct to House of Stake telegram group, House of Stake Forum, gov.houseofstake.org voting platform, and community calls as agreements for participation.  

**Moderation and appeals**  

* Independent body of **at least 3 members** with rotation and recusal rules. To be developed post ratification.  

**AI assistance**  

* Testing AI-powered tooling in development, for case management and moderation.  

**Feedback collection**  

*  After implementation, Continuous feedback will be collected by Hack Humanity through workshops, forms, and analysis of governance performance, to update the CoC (when and if needed).  

**Data protection**  

* Data logging and confidentiality from case summaries; strict access controls.  

## Team & Accountability  

- **Responsible:** To set up, develop & monitor: @HackHumanity — service provider hired by NEAR Foundation. To avoid conflicts of interest, **no Hack Humanity members will participate in moderation or appeals**.  
- **Accountable to:** Near Foundation, House of Stake, Screening Committee, Head of Governance.  


## Security Considerations  

What are the security implications of this proposal?  
* **Privacy preserving.** A risk is that the authorized body to review cases fails to preserve privacy, strategic confidentiality, and due diligence for cases managed. To mitigate that risk, roles must be made accountable.  
* **AI black box and hallucination.** Humans have final authority, and all AI‑assisted steps must be auditable for appeals.  


## Conflict of Interest  

The proposer has read and agrees to the CoC. **Hack Humanity is a hired service provider** and will **not** serve in moderation or appeals.
