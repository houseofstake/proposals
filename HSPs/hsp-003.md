## Proposal Type

* Sensing Proposal: This Sensing Proposal (see https://github.com/houseofstake/proposals/blob/main/HSPs/hsp-001.md) serves to gauge community sentiment and facilitate open discussion ahead of a binding Decision Proposal. It is non-binding and carries no direct outcomes. Its purpose is to gather input, build visibility, and allow those intending to vote in the formal proposal to position their stake within HoS in advance. Only holders who have locked NEAR into veNEAR before the Decision Proposal goes live will be eligible to vote. This sensing phase provides the necessary time for all interested members to prepare and participate effectively in the final decision.

##  Context & Alignment

* This proposal (HSP-003) is part of a coordinated tokenomics enhancement initiative developed collaboratively by Meta Pool, Linear, Hot, and Gauntlet to support NEAR’s long-term economic sustainability and decentralized governance. It builds directly on HSP-002, which establishes a validator support program to preserve decentralization following the planned inflation reduction from 5% to 2.5%. 
* While HSP-002 addresses validator-side stability, HSP-003 focuses on ensuring active governance participation among NEAR token holders through veNEAR incentives. Together, these proposals create a balanced transition: validators remain economically viable, and token holders are encouraged to engage in on-chain decision-making.
* This proposal aligns with the principles of the House of Stake Constitution, particularly decentralization, transparency, accountability, and sustainability, by creating fair, data-driven incentives that strengthen governance participation without undermining network economics.

## Abstract

This proposal establishes an initial 3-month rewards program for veNEAR holders to incentivize governance participation in the House of Stake. The program implements a dynamic yield structure targeting competitive APY rates between 4.2% (leveraged staking) and 4.5% (post-reduction direct staking), with a budget of 280,682 NEAR to achieve our goal of migrating 60M NEAR to House of Stake. This proposal depends on HSP-002 (Validator Support Program) being implemented. Continuation of rewards beyond 90 days will require a subsequent proposal.

## Situation

NEAR token holders face competing yield opportunities through leveraged staking (4.2% APY) and liquid staking tokens (LSTs) in DeFi protocols. With a future reduction in inflation from 5% to 2.5%, effective direct staking APY will decrease from approximately 9% to 4.5% (assuming 50% of supply remains staked). Without competitive incentives for veNEAR, adoption of the House of Stake governance system may lag, hampering NEAR's ability to fund grants, protocol improvements, and community initiatives through collective decision-making.

The context of this proposal is fundamentally shaped by the NEAR Tokenomics Enhancement Package (HSP-002). A future reduction in NEAR’s inflation creates a new opportunity: the lowering of baseline staking yields to 4.5% makes it economically feasible to offer veNEAR rewards that are competitive without being excessive. HSP-002's validator support program ensures network decentralization is maintained even as validator rewards are reduced by approximately 50%. Together, these create the conditions for a sustainable veNEAR incentive program.

Early momentum is critical when launching a new governance system in a mature ecosystem. Slow adoption could create challenges for new strategic initiatives including NEAR Intents, NEAR AI, and application growth. If House of Stake fails to attract sufficient participation in its first months, it risks becoming irrelevant before realizing its potential to enable effective, stake-weighted governance for the NEAR ecosystem.

## Mission

**Objectives:**

* Migrate 60M NEAR to House of Stake within the first 3 months of launch
* Achieve competitive yield for veNEAR holders between leveraged staking APY (4.2%) and any future reduction in direct staking APY (to ~4.5%)
* Catalyze network effects by spiking momentum at launch
* Enable robust governance participation to fund ecosystem development
* Maintain financial discipline by optimizing reward expenditure relative to governance engagement
* Establish baseline metrics and learnings to inform future incentive proposals

**Outcomes (3-Month Period):**

* Month 1: 10M NEAR migrated to House of Stake
* Month 2: 30M NEAR migrated
* Month 3: 60M NEAR migrated (10% of staked NEAR)
* Reward efficiency ratio of 100-180+ NEAR gained per NEAR spent
* Comprehensive program evaluation to guide future proposals

**Note:** This proposal covers only the initial 90-day period. Any continuation or modification of the rewards program beyond this period will require a new proposal based on the outcomes and learnings from this pilot phase.

## Approach

### 3-Month Pilot Reward Structure

This proposal implements a phased reward structure for the initial 90-day pilot period only. Based on learnings from this pilot, a subsequent proposal will be required to continue or modify the incentive program.

**Month 1: Launch Incentive**

* Fixed 7.5% APY on first 10M NEAR deposited
* Estimated monthly rewards: 62,500 NEAR
* Rationale: Strong launch incentive to drive initial adoption

**Month 2: Dynamic Scaling**

* Target supply: 30M NEAR
* APY calculated as: Rewards_APY = 198 / √(NEAR_supply) = 3.6%
* Estimated rewards: 90,374 NEAR

**Month 3: Continuation of Dynamic Scaling**

* Target supply: 60M NEAR
* APY: 2.6% (using dynamic formula)
* Estimated rewards: 127,808 NEAR

The dynamic formula is derived from research on comparable staking ecosystems and ensures rewards remain competitive with on-chain yield opportunities while preventing excessive dilution as adoption scales.

### Future Phases (For Reference Only)

The sections below outline potential future phases to provide context for long-term planning. However, these phases are NOT included in this proposal and will require separate governance approval.

**Potential Phase 3 (Months 4-6):**

* Month 4 (90M supply): 2.1% APY, ~156,533 NEAR
* Month 5 (120M supply): 1.8% APY, ~180,748 NEAR
* Month 6 (150M supply): 1.6% APY, ~202,083 NEAR

**Potential Phase 4 (Months 7-9):**

* Month 7 (192M supply): 1.4% APY, ~228,631 NEAR
* Month 8 (228M supply): 1.3% APY, ~249,145 NEAR
* Month 9 (270M supply): 1.2% APY, ~271,123 NEAR

**Longer-Term Considerations:** At full adoption (500M NEAR), annual rewards could reach 29M NEAR, exceeding the 5M NEAR inflation allocation. Future proposals will need to address sustainable funding mechanisms, potentially including: allocating a larger portion of token inflation to veNEAR, implementing new revenue streams from ecosystem growth, adjusting reward formulas, or utilizing treasury reserves strategically.

### Risks and Limitations

**Yield Competition:** NEAR holders can pursue alternative yields through leveraged staking (4.2% APY) and LP incentives using LSTs. However under a reduction of direct staking yields to approximately 4.5%, the competitive landscape becomes more favorable for veNEAR rewards. The proposed APY range (starting at 7.5% for the first 10M, then declining dynamically) positions veNEAR as attractive relative to all alternatives while remaining economically sustainable.

**Behavioral Uncertainty:** Token holder behavior in the early days is unpredictable. The proposed structure includes a cushion for fluctuating outcomes and will be continuously monitored for efficiency.

**Budget Constraints:** As veNEAR supply grows beyond this 3-month pilot, annual reward requirements will increase substantially. Future proposals will need to address long-term sustainability, including potential treasury allocations or adjustments to the reward formula. This pilot will provide critical data to inform those decisions.

## Technical Specification

### Reward Program Parameters

**3-Month Pilot Structure:**

* Month 1: Fixed 7.5% APY on first 10M NEAR deposited
* Month 2-3: Dynamic APY calculated as: APY = 198 / √(Total_veNEAR_Supply)
* Total budget: 280,682 NEAR

**Target Metrics:**

* Month 1: 10M NEAR in veNEAR
* Month 2: 30M NEAR in veNEAR
* Month 3: 60M NEAR in veNEAR (10% of staked NEAR)

### Implementation Details

The technical and financial details of the reward distribution mechanism (including smart contract specifications, distribution frequency, calculation methods, and claiming procedures) are beyond the scope of this proposal and will be addressed in a separate technical implementation proposal. This governance proposal establishes the policy framework, budget allocation, and success criteria for the pilot program.

### Funding Source

All rewards will be funded exclusively from the NEAR House of Stake Foundation treasury. The Foundation has allocated sufficient resources to support this 90-day pilot program.

### Monitoring Metrics

**Primary Efficiency Metric:**

> Efficiency Ratio = Incremental_NEAR_Gained_per_Month / Monthly_NEAR_Incentive_Spent

* Target range months 1-3: 100-180+

**Secondary Metrics:**

* Total veNEAR supply
* Percentage of staked NEAR migrated to House of Stake
* Active governance participation rates
* Proposal submission and voting activity

### Adjustment Mechanism

Gauntlet will provide monthly reports evaluating program efficiency during the 3-month pilot. These reports will inform the design of any subsequent incentive proposals, allowing the House of Stake Security Council to implement emergency adjustments during the pilot period. The Security Council will have the ability to unilaterally pause or adjust the incentive program at its discretion in the case of significant market shifts or a risk event.

## Backwards Compatibility

This proposal introduces new reward mechanisms for the initial 90-day period and does not conflict with existing NEAR protocol staking. Users can continue staking NEAR through traditional validators while the veNEAR rewards program operates independently.

**Critical Dependencies:**

This proposal hinges on a concurrent or prior reduction in inflation by the validator set. The economic viability and the entire reward structure are based on a projected decrease in staking APY from approximately 9% to 4.5%. Without this inflation reduction, veNEAR rewards would be uncompetitive compared to standard staking, rendering the program ineffective.

To ensure validator decentralization is maintained despite reduced rewards, HSP-002 must be implemented. While not a direct technical dependency, HSP-002 addresses the economic impact on validators from inflation reduction, thus safeguarding network security within the broader tokenomics package.

No smart contract modifications to the existing staking infrastructure are required. The pilot phase will enable testing and refinement before long-term reward structures are finalized. Ideally, both HSP-002 and HSP-003 should be approved and implemented together as a unified tokenomics enhancement package.

### Extended Budget Projections (For Reference Only)

These figures are provided for context and long-term planning but are NOT part of this proposal:

|Period|Estimated Amount (NEAR)|Notes|
| --- | --- | --- |
|Months 4-6|~539,364|Would require new proposal|
|Months 7-9|~748,899|Would require new proposal|
|**Potential Year 1 Total**|**~1,568,945**|**Illustrative only**|

Any rewards beyond the initial 3-month period will require a new governance proposal with updated targets, budgets, and mechanisms based on pilot results.

## Team & Accountability

**Responsible:**

* Gauntlet: Modeling, monitoring, and monthly reporting during pilot
* NEAR House of Stake Foundation: Initial funding and program oversight
* House of Stake governance: Approval of any continuation proposals

**Accountable to:** House of Stake governance and NEAR community

**Reporting Requirements:**

* Monthly public reports on pilot metrics (months 1, 2, and 3)
* Comprehensive final evaluation at end of month 3
* Recommendations for continuation, modification, or termination
* Data and learnings to inform future incentive proposals

**Pilot Governance:**

* This 90-day pilot runs as approved; no mid-pilot adjustments without emergency proposal
* At month 3, rewards automatically cease unless a new proposal is approved
* Follow-up proposal should be submitted before end of month 2 to allow discussion time

## Security Considerations

### Economic Security

* **Funding Source:** The reward program is funded by the NEAR House of Stake Foundation treasury, ensuring clear accountability and no impact on protocol-level inflation mechanisms.
* **Coordinated Package:** This proposal is part of a two-part tokenomics enhancement. HSP-002 maintains validator decentralization, and HSP-003 (this proposal) ensures governance participation. Together they create a more sustainable economic model in the event of a reduction in protocol inflation.
* **Budget Risk:** At full adoption beyond this pilot, continued rewards would require either additional treasury allocations or alternative funding mechanisms to be proposed by the community.
* **Market Impact:** Large reward distributions could create selling pressure; phased distribution and declining APY mitigate this risk

### Gaming Resistance

* Stake-weighted voting reduces incentive for Sybil attacks
* Minimum lock periods for veNEAR discourage short-term reward farming
* Monitoring systems will track anomalous behavior patterns

### Smart Contract Risk

* Reward distribution contracts must be thoroughly audited before deployment
* Emergency pause functionality should be implemented
* Multi-signature controls on reward pool management

### Governance Attack Surface

* Large veNEAR holders could theoretically influence reward rate adjustments
* This is inherent to stake-weighted governance and mitigated by transparent discussion periods
* Community can reject proposals that benefit small groups at ecosystem expense
