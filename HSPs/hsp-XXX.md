## Abstract

NEAR Protocol has been invited to join the UN Blockchain Council. This proposal requests NEAR House of Stake Foundation to accept this membership on behalf of the NEAR ecosystem and appoint representatives (Gustav Friis and Peter Humaidan from NEARWEEK) to actively participate in UN workshops, technical advisory roles, and thought leadership activities. The desired outcome is establishing NEAR's presence alongside major protocols in shaping global blockchain standards for UN agencies and government initiatives.

## Context & Alignment

* This proposal originated from blockchain community connections in Copenhagen and has been discussed on the NEAR governance forum for 7 days with positive reception. The NEAR Foundation declined to pursue this opportunity, but the community recognizes its strategic value.
* This initiative aligns with NEAR's core values of real-world impact (directly supporting UN Sustainable Development Goals), ecosystem growth (attracting developers focused on social impact use cases), institutional legitimacy (positioning NEAR for government and enterprise partnerships), and community empowerment (community-driven initiative when Foundation declined).
* The UN Blockchain Council has consolidated 200+ UN blockchain and AI pilots, with the mandate of pushing standards into production-ready UN wide initiatives. Council members and partners include Ethereum Foundation, Solana Foundation, Stellar Development Foundation, Cardano Foundation, Sui Foundation, Algorand Foundation, Polygon Labs, Hedera, Arbitrum Foundation, Filecoin Foundation, Dfinity Foundation, Web3 Foundation, Celo Foundation, and Tether.
* Similar blockchain protocol participation in UN initiatives has resulted in protocol integration into UN accelerator programs, direct government and institutional partnership opportunities, technical standards development for blockchain deployment, and developer ecosystem growth in impact-focused verticals.

## Situation

**Strategic Opportunity:** NEAR Protocol has been invited to join the UN Blockchain Council, presenting a significant opportunity to position NEAR alongside major blockchain protocols (Ethereum Foundation, Solana Foundation, Stellar Development Foundation, Cardano Foundation, Sui Foundation, and others) in shaping the future of blockchain for global impact:

1. **Institutional Leadership**: The UN is consolidating 200+ blockchain and AI pilots into production systems across UN agencies, working directly with governments and major enterprises to establish standards. Council membership positions NEAR as a technical partner in defining how blockchain technology serves sustainable development goals.

2. **Market Access**: UN accelerators actively promote member protocols to their global network, creating direct pathways for NEAR developers and projects to access government and institutional partnerships worth billions in potential development.

3. **Standards Development**: Council members contribute to technical frameworks that will guide blockchain deployment across UN agencies and government initiatives globally. This is NEAR's opportunity to ensure its technical innovations (AI integration, chain abstraction, intents) shape emerging standards.

4. **Ecosystem Growth**: UN programs provide funding and acceleration opportunities specifically for member protocols, creating a pipeline for impact-focused developers and projects to build on NEAR.

**Why Now:** Major protocols are already engaged in standards development and building relationships with UN agencies. NEAR's participation ensures the ecosystem has voice and influence in these initiatives as they're being shaped. The invitation represents recognition of NEAR's technical capabilities and potential for real-world impact.

**The Ask:** Accept the invitation and appoint representatives to actively participate, ensuring NEAR captures this strategic opportunity for institutional positioning, developer ecosystem growth, and real-world adoption.

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

**Standards & Technical Contribution:**
1. NEAR representatives contribute to at least 1 major technical standard or framework relevant to UN blockchain deployment (with emphasis on cross-chain liquidity, user-owned AI infrastructure, or chain abstraction for public sector use cases)

**Thought Leadership & Visibility:**
2. Minimum 4 thought leadership outputs annually (X Spaces with UN partners, speaking engagements at UN events, co-authored whitepapers, or published case studies on blockchain for SDGs)
3. NEAR featured as council member on UN Blockchain Council website, marketing materials, and partner communications

**Direct Institutional Engagement:**
4. Generate at least 1 qualified lead per quarter for MVP using NEAR tech for UN agencies or governments (minimum 4 annually)

**Ecosystem Positioning:**
5. Secure minimum 3 pieces of public social proof (partner logo placements, joint announcements, co-hosted events, or media coverage positioning NEAR in UN blockchain initiatives)

## Budget & Resources

**Year 1 Budget Request: $20,000 USD**

* Budget Breakdown: Travel & accommodation for UN events: $20,000 (estimated 2-4 annual events requiring international travel, 2 representatives per event, includes flights, accommodation, meals, ground transportation)
* Funding Source: House of Stake treasury allocation
* Payment Schedule: Reimbursement-based payment structure, representatives submit expense reports with receipts, quarterly disbursement cycle aligned with reporting schedule, pre-approved budget cap of $20,000 for Year 1

**Resource Requirements:**

* Time Commitment: 10-15 hours monthly per representative for council participation, quarterly reporting 5-10 hours per representative, event travel time variable based on location and frequency
* Support Requirements: Communication and coordination support from NEARWEEK infrastructure, access to NEAR technical resources for standards development, connection facilitation with NEAR Foundation teams (as appropriate)

**Budget Justification:**

* Low Investment, High Return: The requested budget represents modest investment compared to typical protocol marketing spend at major conferences ($50-100k+), business development salaries for institutional partnerships ($150k+ annually), and grant programs for ecosystem development ($500k+ annually)
* Comparable Opportunities: Other protocols spend significantly more on institutional positioning without the strategic access this membership provides
* Risk-Adjusted Value: Even if only 1-2 of the defined KPIs are achieved, the strategic value justifies the investment

## Team & Accountability

**Primary Representatives (Year 1):**

* Gustav Friis: Email gus@nearweek.com, NEAR Address nearweek.near, NEARWEEK AG lead with 4+ years covering NEAR ecosystem, multilingual (English/Danish), extensive experience in AI x crypto content strategy, blockchain technology, and community development. Relevant experience includes managing NEARWEEK newsletter (20,000+ subscribers), AI content automation development, NEAR ecosystem grant proposals, technical writing, and conference participation.
* Peter Humaidan: Email p3ter@nearweek.com, NEAR Address nearweek.near, NEARWEEK team member with blockchain community connections in Copenhagen and social impact x technology focus. Relevant experience includes community engagement, blockchain ecosystem development, and partnership development.

**Accountability Structure:**

* Reporting Cadence: Quarterly written reports to House of Stake governance forum, annual comprehensive review with KPI assessment, and ad-hoc updates for significant developments
* Performance Evaluation: Quarterly review against defined KPIs, community feedback through governance forum, House of Stake retains authority to replace representatives if performance inadequate
* Replacement Mechanism: If representatives fail to meet 75% attendance target for 2 consecutive quarters, if quarterly reports are not delivered on schedule, if community feedback indicates poor representation, or at House of Stake discretion based on governance vote
* Transition Plan: Year 1 serves as pilot phase with NEARWEEK representatives, Month 12 review includes transition planning, Year 2+ representatives appointed through House of Stake governance process, knowledge transfer period between initial and permanent representatives

**Conflict of Interest Disclosure:**

Both representatives are affiliated with NEARWEEK AG, a Swiss company covering the NEAR Protocol ecosystem. NEARWEEK operates independently and does not receive direct financial benefit from this proposal beyond the travel reimbursements specified in the budget. This proposal serves the broader NEAR ecosystem without benefiting NEARWEEK or any specific entity disproportionately. The opportunity originated through community connections and represents a community-driven initiative. House of Stake maintains full oversight and can replace representatives at any time, ensuring accountability to the broader community rather than any single organization. The authors have read and agree with the House of Stake Conflict of Interest policy.

## Security Considerations

**Operational Security:**

* Representative Authority: Representatives speak on behalf of House of Stake / NEAR ecosystem in UN contexts. Representatives do not have authority to commit NEAR Protocol to technical implementations without governance approval. Representatives cannot bind NEAR Protocol to financial commitments beyond approved budget. All significant agreements or commitments must be brought to House of Stake governance.
* Information Security: Representatives handle potentially sensitive information about UN projects and government initiatives. Standard confidentiality practices apply to non-public information. Public communications about NEAR participation require no special security measures. No access to NEAR Protocol private keys or sensitive technical infrastructure required.
* Reputational Risk: Representatives' conduct reflects on NEAR ecosystem. Clear code of conduct expected: professional, respectful, technically accurate. House of Stake can remove representatives if conduct damages NEAR reputation. Quarterly reviews include assessment of community feedback on representation quality.

**Technical Security:**

* No Protocol Changes: This proposal does not involve any changes to NEAR Protocol technical infrastructure, smart contracts, or on-chain parameters. Therefore, no direct technical security risks exist.
* Standards Development Participation: Representatives may contribute to technical standards for blockchain integration. Any NEAR-specific technical recommendations must be validated by NEAR technical teams. Standards participation is advisory and does not commit NEAR Protocol to implementation.

**Financial Security:**

* Budget Controls: Fixed budget cap of $20,000 for Year 1, reimbursement-based payment structure requires receipts, quarterly reporting provides transparency on expenditures, no discretionary spending authority beyond approved budget
* Treasury Security: Payment from House of Stake treasury follows standard disbursement procedures, no special access or privileges required, standard multisig controls apply
